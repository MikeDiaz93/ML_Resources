# ML Resources

GitHub Repo with various ML/AI/DS resources that I find useful. I'll populate it with links to articles, libraries, and other resources that I come across. 


## Tabular Data ML

### General

* Tabular Data: Deep Learning is Not All You Need: https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.03253

### NNs for Tabular Data

* pytorch-widedeep, deep learning for tabular data IV: Deep Learning vs LightGBM. A thorough comparison between DL algorithms and LightGBM for tabular data for classification and regression problems: https://jrzaurin.github.io/infinitoml/2021/05/28/pytorch-widedeep_iv.html

* SAINT: Improved Neural Networks for Tabular Data via Row Attention and Contrastive Pre-Training: https://github.com/somepago/saint (repo)
* SAINT paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.01342

### Boosting

### Neural Networks - General

Every Model Learned by Gradient Descent Is Approximately a Kernel Machine: https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.00152

### NNs vs Kernel Methods

The quest for adaptivity: exploring https://francisbach.com/quest-for-adaptivity/

### Stacking

vecstack is a handy little library that implements the stacking transformations with your train and test data. It has both the functional interface and the sklearn fit transform interface: https://github.com/vecxoz/vecstack

### Autoencoders

RecoTour III: Variational Autoencoders for Collaborative Filtering with Mxnet and Pytorch: https://jrzaurin.github.io/infinitoml/2020/05/15/mult-vae.html

### Hyperparameter Tuning

## Auto ML

* Automated Machine Learning: Methods, Systems, Challenges. Probably the single best monograph on AutoML. Published in 2019, so not quite the cutting edge, but still very useful. https://www.amazon.com/Automated-Machine-Learning-Challenges-Springer-ebook/dp/B07S3MLGFW/
* H2O Driverless AI documentation: https://docs.h2o.ai/driverless-ai/latest-stable/docs/userguide/index.html

## Computer Vision

* Scaling Vision Transformers: ‘As a result, we successfully train a ViT model with two billion parameters, which attains a new state-of-the-art on ImageNet of 90.45% top-1 accuracy. The model also performs well on few-shot learning, for example, attaining 84.86% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet with only 10 examples per class.’

## Social Media Analysis

* Birds of the Same Feather Tweet Together. Bayesian Ideal Point Estimation Using Twitter Data. Analysis of homophily of Politicians on Twitter. http://pablobarbera.com/static/barbera_twitter_ideal_points.pdf
* Leadership Communication and Power: Measuring Leadership in the U.S. House of Representatives from Social Media Data: https://preprints.apsanet.org/engage/apsa/article-details/60c239b28214c646e0a61589
