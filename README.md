# ML Resources

GitHub Repo with various ML/AI/DS resources that I find useful. I'll populate it with links to articles, libraries, and other resources that I come across. 


## Tabular Data ML

### General

* Tabular Data: Deep Learning is Not All You Need: https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.03253

## Auto ML

### Books and Articles

* Automated Machine Learning: Methods, Systems, Challenges. Probably the single best monograph on AutoML. Published in 2019, so not quite the cutting edge, but still very useful. https://www.amazon.com/Automated-Machine-Learning-Challenges-Springer-ebook/dp/B07S3MLGFW/
* Towards Automated Machine Learning: Evaluation and Comparison of AutoML Approaches and Tools: https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.05557
* AutoML: A Survey of the State-of-the-Art: https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.00709
* Can AutoML outperform humans? An evaluation on popular OpenML datasets using AutoML Benchmark: https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01564

### Auto ML Software

* H2O Driverless AI documentation: https://docs.h2o.ai/driverless-ai/latest-stable/docs/userguide/index.html

### Hyperparameter Tuning Software

* hyperopt-sklearn: https://github.com/hyperopt/hyperopt-sklearn


## Computer Vision

* Scaling Vision Transformers: ‘As a result, we successfully train a ViT model with two billion parameters, which attains a new state-of-the-art on ImageNet of 90.45% top-1 accuracy. The model also performs well on few-shot learning, for example, attaining 84.86% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet with only 10 examples per class.’
https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.04560
